Things to study ->
    mongodb installation
    mongodb connection
    schema
    model
    crud - create read update delete


    Hmare 2 server hai ek to node ka hai and dusra mongodb ka hai and mongoose humko help karta hai node ke server ko mongo ke server se connect karne mei

ORM & ODM :-
    Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) and Object-Document Mapping (ODM) are both techniques that allow developers to interact with databases using programming language objects instead of writing raw SQL queries: 


mongoose.Schema() -> ek method hai jo ki accept krta hai object 
mongoose.model() -> it will create a model kuki without creating model we cannot perform crud operation and hum jo bhi model create karenge uska plurarised form dekhne ko milega i.e. agr humne mongoose.model("user") -> user naam ka model bnaya to wo users naam se bnega.

agr hum chahte hai ki hmara crud operation direct na perform hoke tbb perform ho jab jab kisi operation ka route call ho to chale jaise ki jab (/create) ka route call ho to -  to create operation ho same as for delete, update and users...
so in order to do that we have to export our models into node using modules.exports = mongoose.model("").
modules.export is not a method it is a value so we have to apply an (=) sign and then assign the value


find() - array deta hai
findOne() - object deta hai
